I like the challenges on [HackerRank](https://www.hackerrank.com/domains/python/py-introduction) to practice. The discussion on each challenge is great for seeing how other people approach the problem and to ask questions. The free beginner lesson on [DataQuest](https://www.dataquest.io/path/data-scientist) are also great if you are just starting out or want more practice."
